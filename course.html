                <h3> Shiksha </h3>
                <p>One of the most affected victims of the pandemic are children who now have no access to schools. While a lot of children have the means for online classes, underprivileged children are still deprived of learning as they have no access to computers or smart phones. These children already have had difficult journeys, having fought the shackles of poverty, child labour, and much more to finally reach school. But the pandemic has reversed their years of struggle.
                    For lakhs of such children, education has come to a halt. They can't afford smart phones, can't count on support of parents for home learning.</p>

                <h3> Share Food</h3>
                <p>The world today is facing an unprecedented challenge in the form of COVID 19. Economies have fallen, mighty nations have surrendered and life as man knows it, has been reduced to the confines of their homes. And while the world is battling the virus, here in our country we have another war also to win. Thousands of migrant workers and daily wagers have been left jobless in the wake of the current state of lockdown which has affected children and women the most. And while most of us are worrying about our kid's education, our job, our future, our businesses and its prospects and how to handle time at home in isolation or simply getting bored at home.</p>

                <h3> You Can Fly</h3>
                <p>'You Can Fly' is an effort to enable, equip and empower girl children with quality education, proper nutrition, good health, adequate skills, and above all a lot of self-confidence to help them live their lives to their fullest potential.
                    This is also a step towards sensitizing the civil society at large and helping create a girl child/women friendly society to help her thrive.
                    Let us all come forward and join hands to give wings to her dreams. Empower, educate, and make her strong to stand her own ground and shine in her efforts.</p>
